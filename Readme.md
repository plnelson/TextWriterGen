## TextWriterGen
A simple code generator for writing text

### Background
I worked on a team that used a super simple text generator for writing autogenerated code.  I found
this text generator useful for other projects, but I don't know where the source code is and has no
license.  I decided to recreate a similar text generator for use is my own projects.  It is simple
enough to release the code for it. Hopefully you find it useful!

### Usage Example
TextWriterGen uses its own output to write the output text.  The file Self.txt contains the
template used for generating the code.  The file is generated using the following command line:

```
TextWriterGen.exe TextWriterGen CodeText Self.txt CodeText.generated.cs
```
